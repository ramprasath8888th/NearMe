        Krishna River canals are a vital network, especially in its fertile delta (Andhra Pradesh), controlled by structures like the Vijayawada weir, distributing water for extensive irrigation, with prominent examples like the Eluru Canal (though facing issues like encroachment), forming crucial parts of India's National Waterways (NW4) for transport, and serving as essential links for agriculture and industry across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh
